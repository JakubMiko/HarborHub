# Harbor Hub

## Purpose

This project is built for learning and experimenting with **GraphQL**. The goal is to create an API for managing a marina/port: tracking users who keep their yachts, handling payments, storing information about boats, and other port-related activities.

Although I use knowledge from online courses and tutorials, the structure and implementation are custom and not a direct copy of any specific course. I continuously expand this README with insights and solutions I've learned while building the project.

## Personal Notes

The following sections of the README serve as my notebook, where I list and summarize key concepts and information I have learned throughout the development process.
